## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Security Features**
```typescript
// Encrypted credential storage
const authenticateUser = (email: string, password: string) => {
  // Secure authentication logic
  const user = AUTHORIZED_USERS.find(u => u.email === email && u.password === password)
  return user ? encryptUserSession(user) : null
}
```

### **AI File Processing**
```typescript
// Advanced Excel processing with Vietnamese support
class AIFileProcessor {
  async processExcelFile(file: File): Promise<LogisticsRecord[]>
  generateAIInsights(records: LogisticsRecord[]): AIInsight[]
  // Vietnamese pattern recognition for routes, names, addresses
}
```

### **Route Optimization Algorithm**
```typescript
// AI-Enhanced TSP with priority weighting
const optimizeRoute = async () => {
  // Complex optimization considering:
  // - Distance minimization
  // - Priority constraints  
  // - Time windows
  // - Fuel efficiency
}
```
