# AUTOMATION PLAN RENDERING FIX

## Issue Identified
The automation plan download functionality exists in source code but is not rendering in the live application because:

1. The results panel (right sidebar) is empty until files are analyzed
2. The automation plan components only appear after successful analysis
3. The demo functionality needs to be properly triggered to show the automation plan

## Root Cause
The automation plan download buttons are conditionally rendered only when:
- `analysisResults` state is populated
- `automationPlan` state is populated
- Analysis is completed successfully

## Solution Implementation
1. Fix the demo functionality to properly trigger analysis
2. Ensure automation plan components render correctly
3. Test the complete workflow from upload to download

## Files to Fix
- `/src/app/file-learning/page.tsx` - Main component
- `/src/lib/intelligentFileProcessor.ts` - Analysis engine
- `/src/lib/automationPlanGenerator.ts` - Plan generator
- `/src/components/AutomationPlanPreview.tsx` - Preview component

## Expected Result
After fix:
- Demo button triggers analysis and shows automation plan
- Download buttons appear in the results panel
- Preview functionality works correctly
- Files can be downloaded in PDF/Excel format
