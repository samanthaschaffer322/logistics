## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git
- Supabase account
- Ollama (for local AI)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/logistics.git
cd logistics
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Supabase

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Settings > API to get your project URL and anon key
3. Copy the database schema from `supabase/schema.sql` and run it in your Supabase SQL editor

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Ollama Configuration (for local AI)
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434

# Mapbox Configuration (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-mapbox-token

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 5. Set Up Ollama (Optional - for AI features)

Install Ollama and download the required models:

```bash
# Install Ollama (macOS)
brew install ollama

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# Download AI models
ollama pull deepseek-r1
ollama pull gemma2
```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üìä Database Schema

The application uses the following main tables:

- **users** - User authentication and roles
- **warehouse** - Warehouse locations and managers
- **inventory** - Stock items and quantities
- **fleet** - Vehicle and driver information
- **driver_schedule** - Driver assignments and routes
- **distribution_orders** - Customer orders and deliveries
- **procurement** - Purchase orders and suppliers
- **uploaded_plans** - AI learning from uploaded files

## üîß Configuration

### Supabase Setup

1. **Authentication**: Enable email/password authentication in Supabase Auth settings
2. **Row Level Security**: The schema includes RLS policies for secure data access
3. **Storage**: Set up a bucket for file uploads (logistics plans, documents)

### Role-Based Access

The application supports 5 user roles:
- **admin**: Full access to all modules
- **warehouse**: Inventory and warehouse management
- **transport**: Fleet and transportation management
- **distribution**: Order fulfillment and delivery
- **procurement**: Purchase orders and supplier management

## üöÄ Deployment

### Cloudflare Pages

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Cloudflare Pages
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set output directory: `out` (if using static export) or `.next` (for SSR)
4. Add environment variables in Cloudflare Pages settings

### Vercel

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t logiai .
docker run -p 3000:3000 logiai
```
