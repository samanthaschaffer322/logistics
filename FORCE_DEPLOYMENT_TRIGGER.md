# ðŸš€ FORCE DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER

This file is created to trigger a new Cloudflare Pages deployment.

**Timestamp**: ${new Date().toISOString()}
**Reason**: User reports changes not reflected in live application
**Action**: Force new deployment with comprehensive route optimizer

## Changes That Should Be Live:

1. **Comprehensive Route Optimizer** at `/comprehensive-route-optimizer`
2. **Fixed Login System** with MetaMask protection
3. **Enhanced Vietnam Map** integration
4. **Updated Navigation** with new route optimizer link

## Deployment Verification:

- âœ… Build: Successful (verified locally)
- âœ… Git: All changes pushed to main branch
- ðŸ”„ Cloudflare: Triggering new deployment

If this deployment doesn't reflect changes, we may need to:
1. Check Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Verify build settings in Cloudflare
4. Check for any deployment errors

**Expected Result**: All new features should be visible after this deployment completes.
