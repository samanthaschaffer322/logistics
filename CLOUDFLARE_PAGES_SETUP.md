# 🚀 Cloudflare Pages Setup Guide - FRAMEWORK DETECTION FIX

## Problem: Framework Keeps Resetting to "None"

This happens because Cloudflare Pages can't properly detect the Next.js framework. Here's the complete fix:

### ✅ Step 1: Verify Project Structure

Your project now has the correct structure:
```
logistics/
├── package.json          ← Contains "next": "^15.4.5"
├── next.config.js         ← Proper Next.js configuration
├── src/                   ← Source code
├── public/               ← Static assets
└── .next/                ← Build output (after npm run build)
```

### ✅ Step 2: EXACT Cloudflare Pages Settings

**IMPORTANT: Follow these steps in order:**

1. **Go to Cloudflare Pages Dashboard**
2. **Delete the existing project** (if framework keeps resetting)
3. **Create a new project**
4. **Connect your GitHub repository**
5. **Use these EXACT settings:**

```
Project name: logistics-ai
Framework preset: Next.js
Build command: npm run build
Build output directory: .next
Root directory: (leave empty)
Environment variables: 
  - OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-Is6s1p1BqoYf21xBywtG2w
  - NODE_VERSION = 18
```

### ✅ Step 3: If Framework Still Resets

**Method 1: Manual Override**
1. After setting "Next.js", immediately click "Save and Deploy"
2. Don't navigate away from the page
3. The build should start with Next.js detected

**Method 2: Use Build Configuration File**
Create `wrangler.toml` in your root directory:
```toml
name = "logistics-ai"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

[build]
command = "npm run build"
cwd = "."

[build.upload]
format = "service-worker"
dir = ".next"
```

**Method 3: Force Framework Detection**
Add this to your `package.json` (already done):
```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build"
  }
}
```

### ✅ Step 4: Verify Build Works Locally

Run these commands to ensure everything works:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

You should see:
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Generating static pages (24/24)
✓ .next directory created
```

### ✅ Step 5: Environment Variables

Set these in Cloudflare Pages:
```
NODE_ENV=production
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-Is6s1p1BqoYf21xBywtG2w
NODE_VERSION=18
```

### ✅ Step 6: Deployment Process

1. **Push to GitHub** (already done)
2. **Create new Cloudflare Pages project**
3. **Select your repository**
4. **Framework preset: Next.js** (should auto-detect now)
5. **Build command: npm run build**
6. **Build output directory: .next**
7. **Add environment variables**
8. **Deploy**

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If framework still resets:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Try incognito/private browsing
3. Delete and recreate the project
4. Contact Cloudflare support with your project details

**If build fails:**
1. Check build logs for specific errors
2. Verify Node.js version is 18+
3. Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
4. Test build locally first

### 🎯 Expected Results

After deployment, your site will have:
- ✅ Interactive Next.js application
- ✅ Working API routes with OpenAI integration
- ✅ Beautiful dark mode UI
- ✅ All features functional
- ✅ Fast loading with CDN caching

### 📞 Final Notes

- The framework detection issue is common with Cloudflare Pages
- Following these exact steps should resolve it
- Your app is properly configured for Next.js deployment
- All dependencies and configurations are correct

**🎉 Your LogiAI platform will be live and fully functional!**
